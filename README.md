# superGoodPasswordGen

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
- I wanted to create a simple applications that prompts the user for input, takes the choices the user made and generate a password based on those choices when the button on the webpage is clicked.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 
- I wanted an easy to use password generator that generated a password based on my choices.
- What problem does it solve? 
- This solves the issue of trying to create your own strong passwords so you don't use the same password you've been using since middle-school.
- What did you learn? 
- Even smaller, simple projects have their own issues and unforeseen problems that you need to work through
